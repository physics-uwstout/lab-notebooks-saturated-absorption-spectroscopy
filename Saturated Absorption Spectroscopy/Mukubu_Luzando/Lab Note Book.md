## Day 1
 Questions:
> What is Saturation?
* In chem it is the state of a solution that contains as much solute as possible at a given temperature or pressure. 
* It is defined by the existence of an equilibrium between pairs of opposing forces or of an exact balance of the rates of the opposing processes.
 >What is Absorption?
 * In wave motion, the transfer of the energy of a wave to matter as the wave passes through it. 
 * If there is only a small fractional absorption of energy, the medium is said to be transparent to that particular radiation, but if all the energy is lost
> What is a Spectroscope?
* A scientific instrument that splits light into its different wavelengths. It is used to identify the spectral composition of the light and can identify wavelengths that humans cannot see, such as infrared and ultraviolet radiation. The instrument consists 
> What is Saturated Absorption?
> What is a Saturated Absorption Spectroscope?
* Measuring the difference between energy levels of electrons.
* A technique using a pump beam to "saturate" gas for measuring the transition frequency between electron states. A second beam of equal frequency is used to "probe" the gas creating measurable stimulated emission.
> What does it do and etc?
* Uses a pump beam to excite electrons in a gas. An opposing probe beam of equal frequency is used to cause stimulated emission of photon which can be measured to find the frequency?

Background.
- Things I needed to know and understand before hand: Doppler broadening, rubidium spectroscopy,
- Questions reading this gave me: 
= What is our ultimate goal and how can our small goals help build into that?
= How do we improve the alignment problems faced while turning the laser
1. The point of all of this is to study atomic energy levels and that is what diode lasers in atomic spectroscopy are good for. 
2. This is cause they have the capacity to resolve hyperfine structures.
3. The ultimate goal of the paper/experiment that gives us the base of our experiment was to obtain spectral data of Rb absorption peaks around 780nmand then match the peaks with known atomic transitions in Rb.
4. Intermediate goal; construction of the external cavity diode laser, capable of producing these resonances in the Rb vapor. Demonstrate the turning capability of our laser across the frequency of the known atomic transitions of rubidium. 
5. Why use diode lasers: provide coherent light and have reasonable output power, higher electrical to optical efficiency, **continuous wavelength turnability** and relatively small and low cost.
6. Disadvantages; bare diodes have a large linewidth(50-100 MHz) and most experiments need linewidths below 1MHz.
7. Upside: they have been studied and can be manipulated to optimize their frequency stability and absolute frequency.
8. Extremely sensitive to optical feedback(as little as 10^-6 of the output light feed back can effect- its frequency stability).
9. **to significantly reduce the bandwidth of a diode laser, an external or extended cavity that has frequency selecting optical elements is usually needed.**
10. External Cavity Stabilization: For the rubidium spectroscopy experiment described they used Littrow configuration. This causes an increase in efficiency but the output beam is wavelength dependent which leads to alignment problems while tuning the laser which is a set back.
11. Originally used a 2400 line/mm grating which was blazed for visible light in order to take advantage of a larger grating angle and more convenient reflection of the zeroeth-order output beam, determined by the grating equation found in Equation 1 where **a= 1/1200lines/mm*1000mm/m**  
2asin(theta)=mh(bendukad h)
12. by observing the tunability of the laser we can further diagnose stability. By adjusting the horizontal component of the grating we can adjust the frequency of the laser and view the diode tune on the Spectra suite program.
13. Spectroscopy plays an essential role in our understanding of the structure of atoms and molecules.
14. Much of what we know about the structural nature of atomic matter comes from spectroscopic investigations. Through the absorption and emission spectra that are emitted when electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter we can understand the way that the components of molecules and atoms interact.
15. By way of doppler broadening we observe resonant frequencies over a continuous dip, in which lies the central resonant frequency w<>0.
