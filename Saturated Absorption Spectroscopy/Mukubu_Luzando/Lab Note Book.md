# Saturated Absorption Spectroscope.
## Day 1
 Questions:
> What is Saturation?
* In chem it is the state of a solution that contains as much solute as possible at a given temperature or pressure. 
* It is defined by the existence of an equilibrium between pairs of opposing forces or of an exact balance of the rates of the opposing processes.
 >What is Absorption?
 * In wave motion, the transfer of the energy of a wave to matter as the wave passes through it. 
 * If there is only a small fractional absorption of energy, the medium is said to be transparent to that particular radiation, but if all the energy is lost
> What is a Spectroscope?
* A scientific instrument that splits light into its different wavelengths. It is used to identify the spectral composition of the light and can identify wavelengths that humans cannot see, such as infrared and ultraviolet radiation. The instrument consists

> What is a Saturated Absorption Spectroscope?
* Measuring the difference between energy levels of electrons.
* A technique using a pump beam to "saturate" gas for measuring the transition frequency between electron states. A second beam of equal frequency is used to "probe" the gas creating measurable stimulated emission.
> What does it do and etc?
* Uses a pump beam to excite electrons in a gas. An opposing probe beam of equal frequency is used to cause stimulated emission of photon which can be measured to find the frequency?
