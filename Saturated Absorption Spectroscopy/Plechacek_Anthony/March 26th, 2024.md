- Get fluorescence in Rubidium. 


## Fluorescence
When absorption happens the rubidium cell will emit light. Talking to Zimmerman this is the next step after achieving grating alignment. Fluorescence will happen at a particular wavelength. To get this I can adjust the current to the laser diode. After that, I can turn on the cooler and change the cooling rate. When adjusting the current the wavelength will change, but mod hopping will occur. When this happens wavelength will be skipped. Cooling the diode will shift where these hops happen and hopefully allow fluorescence.

Went through the current range of the laser diode and did not see any fluorescence. Will have to use the cooler that is attached to the laser.

Turned on the thermocooler controller today. Here is the manual: [[TED200C-Manual(English).pdf]]
The attached cooler is this: [[Cooler 71092-501, SH14-15-06-L-W4.5.pdf]]

The cooler is self can handle up to like 12 amps but the controller is only rated up to 2 amps.

I could not figure out what thermocouple is being used with the system.

After turning it on an error was present saying open. There must be a short in the system somewhere. The whole thing is soldered up and quite a rats nest.
