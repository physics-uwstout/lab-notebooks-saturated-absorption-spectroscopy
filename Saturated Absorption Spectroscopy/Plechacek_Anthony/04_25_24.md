Today I attempted to setup the PID loop on the temperature controller for the old setup. Previously it was setup relatively well for the laser diode mount with the thermoelectric cooler built in. The old setup is different.
Setting up the PID loop seems challenging. I read up on it from Wiki: [Proportional–integral–derivative controller - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller)
Most other sources I found, including the manual for the controller, recommend adjusting the P control first, then the D, and finally the I. After attempting to do so, I gave up and will now work on the paper. The manual recommends having a square wave to control the set temperature, but the function generator I have does not have a small enough frequency to be effective. On to the paper.
