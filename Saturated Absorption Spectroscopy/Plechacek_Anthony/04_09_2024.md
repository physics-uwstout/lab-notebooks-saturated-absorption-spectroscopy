- Setup the new diffraction grating mount.

## Diffraction Mount

Finally got the 3D printed mount back today. There were some issue printing. The filament ran out causing part of the mirror mount to be incomplete. The rest of the parts look good. The supplement document [[3DEDCLAssemblyGuide.pdf]] calls out using a tap to create threads in the parts. I just used a metal screw. Since metal is so much stronger than the plastic prints it is able to make its own thread. Here is the finished assembly. [[20240409_160701080_iOS.jpg]]

A few notes on this:
- Since the mirror mount was not printed completely the mirror is hanging off of the whole a little. I do not suspect this to be a problem but I will find out.
- Where the mirror is currently mounted horizontally the beam hits the mirror right on the edge. It will have to be moved to have the beam hit closer to the center of the mirror.
- The bolt in the center of the diffraction grating mount was to tall for the diffraction grating. The grating could not be tilted down far enough. I ended up heating the screw with a soldering iron to melt the plastic and screwed it in further.
- The screws in the curved slots are near the end of travel. There might have to be new holes drilled to allow the grating base to rotate further.
- Currently the grating and mirror are mounted with hot glue. I did this just to see if eveything was working well before it is permanently bonded.
