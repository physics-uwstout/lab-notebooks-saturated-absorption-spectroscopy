- Configure the 3D printed ECDL with our laser housing.


## 3D Printed ECDL
Since the last day I have been working on modifying the 3D print from [[3D printing an ECDL.pdf]] to fit our [[TCLDM9-Manual.pdf]] laser diode mount. This mount has integrated cooling so it will be easier to control the temperature.

To make this housing fit I have changed out the base of the mount to connect directly to the housing. We also did not have the same equipment as the paper did so the model was adjusted accordingly. 

We will be using:
- ThorLabs PA4FKW piezo
- ThorLabs PKJESP piezo sphere
- ThorLabs PKJCUP piezo cup
	- this and the sphere is recommended by ThorLabs allowing only axial loading on the piezo assisting in the longevity of the device
- Newport 05SD520BD.2 mirror
- ThorLabs GR13-1208 diffraction grating
- AJS100-05H adjustment screws
- ThorLabs L785P090 laser diode
- ThorLabs TCLDM9 laser mount


All the files for the adjustments made can be found under the 3D Supplement Folder.
