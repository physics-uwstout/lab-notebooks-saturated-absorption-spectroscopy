- Get the 3D printed ECDL mount setup

## 3D Print
Continued to modify the print to get it to work. Was fighting a few things:
- The diffraction grating wanted a steep tilt downward with kept interfering with the base.
	- To remedy this paper shims were added to the back of the diode housing tipping it forward.
- The screws in the slots where bottoming out.
	- Added more holes to the base plate.
- When the mirror was mounted the reflection for the diffraction grating was on the edge of the mirror.
	- Reattached the mirror.

After making the above adjustments trying to get everything working I came to the conclusion that the light reflected off of the mirror was hitting the diffraction grating house. The whole thing is not going to work. Here is what I mean: ![[20240411_141443904_iOS.jpg]]


Notes for future print:
- Depending on the diffraction grating and wavelength model in the light path within SolidWorks to make sure everything will line up with out interference.
- Added extra holes in base plate if printed again. The current orange/purple one will work just fine moving forward.
- Create a larger plate for the mirror to mount to. Since mine did not print successfully and the beam was reflecting awkwardly the small plate that the mirror mounts to is not in the correct spot.


## Old Setup
Went back to using the old setup with the janky machined components. Was able to get the thermocooler working. Make sure the sensor is set to the 10k option otherwise the LED will light up indicating no sensor. The coldest I could get the setup was 12.1k ohms = 20.71 C.
Moving forward....
All of the papers attached to these notes use some sort of spectrometer getting precise measurements of the beam. They are able to know how to tune their beam to get close to the correct frequency of absorption. We do not have access to such equipment and our laser diode is 785nm where the experiments use 780nm diodes. 780nm is really close to absorption so they should be able to have an easier time tuning. I believe getting 785nm diode down to the level will be difficult to tune.
Since I do not have the equipment to measure the beam I am using a guess and check system. I can adjust the diffraction grating angle, temperature, and current input to the laser. There is a special relationship to all of these that will get the frequency I am looking for. How do I get there? Current I set the temperature to a cool amount (Say 12k ohms), sweep the current through the diodes workable range, and adjust the diffraction grating a little bit every time I finish a sweep of the current. After going through a full range of current and grating range, I adjust the temperature set point and repeat. More precise procedure coming....

I will know the correct frequency is reached when the rubidium cavity starts to produce fluorescence. It should emit red light slightly larger than the beam going through. This who procedure is done while the lights are off so I do not miss fluorescence. 

## Temperature Reading
The temperature cooler measures the resistance of the thermocouple to know what temperature is set to. Using the assumed correct thermocouple manual [[TH10K-SpecSheet.pdf]] I created code to calculate what resistance set point correlates to temperature and what the actual resistance measurement gives in temperature. The T_act and T_set can be put into the code to measure this.
