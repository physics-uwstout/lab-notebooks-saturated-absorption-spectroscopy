- Setup 3D printed diffraction system
- Setup Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy system

## 3D printed mount update
The 3D print is not done yet. The printer was having difficulties with filament breaking.

## Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy Setup
I will be trying to setup some system to actually get saturated absorption spectroscopy. Collected some mirrors, beam splitter, and mounts. Will use the original laser diode setup for now since the 3D print is not done yet.

Above is the setup I was able to conjure up. The main pump beam is in blue. It comes from the laser through a beam splitter and finally through the sample. The probe beam is in red. From the beam splitter it reflects off of  two mirrors goes through the sample where it interacts with the particles and pump beam then finally to a photodiode.

## Old Setup
Previously the temperature controller was not working with the thermistor and thermocooler. I found a wire that broke free of the solider near the thermistor and put it back together. Now the temperature controller is work. I am not able to identify exactly what thermistor is in the laser housing, but I found one in the lab space that is probably the same: [[TH10K-SpecSheet.pdf]] From the spec sheet I was able to create code to calculate the temperature. The resistance of the thermistor can be found on the temperature controller in kilo-ohms. Plugging this into the code returns the temperature in Celsius. The code is in the diffraction grating python notebook.
