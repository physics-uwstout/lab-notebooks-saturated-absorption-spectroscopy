# Daily Objectives
- How do I get the photodiode to collect data?
- What angle does the diffraction grating need to be at?

## Photodiode
I was successful in reading data from the photodiode. If connected straight up with a coax cable from the diode to the oscilloscope the voltage peak can measured for the intensity. I also connected the photodiode up with a bias current according to the manual. The gave the same results. The spec sheet below shows the schematic that was used. R_L was a 100 ohm resistor. The oscilloscope is connected with alligator clips, each side on opposed ends of the R_L resistor.

 Questions:
 - Can I use the oscilloscope to collect the maximum peak of a wave automatically?

# Diffraction Grating
Well I do not know the exact grating that is on the setup that is original to this lab space. Reading about gratings themselves I found that they should never be touched or chemical be used on the surface of the grating. Currently  I am epoxying the piezo mounting diffraction grating to a mount. This will be used as the diffraction grating from the original lab setup. I definitely touched the grating surface and it is current being held down by a notebook. Hopefully this does not ruin it. Or it works enough for this setup. Below is the diffraction grating we are going to use.

Next step, figure out what angle the diffraction grating should be set to. More will be needed.
