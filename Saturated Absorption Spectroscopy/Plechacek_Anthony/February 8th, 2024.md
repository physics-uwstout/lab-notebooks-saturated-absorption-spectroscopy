## What is Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy?

Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy is a technique to measure the transition frequency of an atom or molecule between the ground and an excited state. This makes me wonder what is the importance of knowing the transition frequency of a molecule? We can use the transition frequency between electrons to calculate the energy levels within a molecule.
