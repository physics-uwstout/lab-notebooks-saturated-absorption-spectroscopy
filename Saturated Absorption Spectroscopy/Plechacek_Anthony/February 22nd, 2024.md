# Daily Objective

- Mount the diffraction grating.
- Measure a change in wavelength from the diffraction grating.


## Rubidium Sample

I have mounted the rubidium sample in a holder and shot the laser without any diffraction grating. Without the tube of gas I measured 544mV and with the sample tube I measured 536mV. Could this be absorption? The laser was running at 50.77mA.


## Calculation for Angle

Using $2asin(\theta) = m\lambda$ where:
$a = 8.3333×10^{-7}m$
$m = 1$
$\lambda = 785×10^{-9}m$
gave results for
$\theta = 28.0994 \degree$

## Stuff I Did Today
- Found a beam splitter to use on our experiment.
- Attached the diffraction grating to our setup.
- Made crude measurements of the rubidium sample.
- Added extensions back to obsidian for inline math and homepage.
- Also added copilot into visual studio.
- Questions await
- I should look at previous semester notebooks and more papers.
