# Daily Objectives
- Try to achieve absorption spectroscopy to occur through adjust current input.
- Setup wavelength spectrometer.

## Wavelength Spectrometer
So we were given a spectrometer from ThorLabs: [[CCS100-Manual.pdf]]. This spectrometer is useful for light of 350nm-700nm. Out laser diode is 785nm. I believe this to be useless. Will move on to looking for different spectrometer. :)

## Absorption Spectroscopy

Experiment was not thoroughly tighten down so laser diode shift with respects to diffraction grating. Alignment lost.... :(
