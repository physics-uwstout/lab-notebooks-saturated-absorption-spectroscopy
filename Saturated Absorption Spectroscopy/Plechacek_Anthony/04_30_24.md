Officially the last day of lab. I woke up early this morning and decided to experiment more. One thing that I have not touched in this project is the piezo electric motor. This is what I tested today. I am not sure the exact model of piezo used in this setup, but the controller (Thorlabs KPZ101) had the voltage range set to 150V, so I am assuming it is some piezo with a max voltage of 150V. Using the Thorlabs Kinesis software to interface with the controller I was able to create a loop that stepped through 0-150V in 1V increments. This loop has a file extension of .Sequence. It is in the Misc Files. With that setup I set the temperature to 12.5kohm and swept the piezo. I did not observe and fluorescence in my cell phone camera from the tube. I am partially concerned that I do not know what fluorescence looks like. [[Plechacek_Anthony/Papers/A simple extended-cavity diode laser (1).pdf|A simple extended-cavity diode laser (1)]] mentions looking for fluorescence with such ease that I do not think I skipped it. The beam must still be off of resonance. 

Now time to finish the paper.
