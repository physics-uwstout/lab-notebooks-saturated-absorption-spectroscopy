## Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy Technique

The biggest problem with absorption spectroscopy is Doppler Broadening. The basis of Doppler Broadening is the interaction of waves with moving particles. If you have a siren traveling towards you the pitch of the siren will be higher than if it were traveling away from you. The sound wave is created closer to you every time compared to the last wave if the siren is traveling towards you. The opposite is true for the siren traveling away. In our experiment we are not looking at a siren but moving gas particles. Since their motion is chaotic we cannot send a wave into the system and expect to get good data since different atoms will interact with different frequencies.

Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy gets around this by having two beams that are propagating in opposite directions. We can use a photodiode to measure each beams to understand there intensities. Since the beams are propagating in opposite directions they will interact with the same molecules that are not moving axially. We can then measure when this interference happens and know that our data is relatively good.

## What kind of diode laser are we using?

Currently in our setup we are using a L785P090. This is a cathode grounded laser diode (LD).
