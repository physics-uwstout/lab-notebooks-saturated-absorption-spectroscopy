# Daily Questions
- How are we going to build the external diode cavity.


## Beginning of Class
	Today I gave my first presentation of class. It went alright. The powerpoint was made 30mins before class since I was busy the rest of the week to create something. The whole experience was scattered brained. Next time I would like to create something that is more cohesive.

# External Diode Cavity

[[A simple extended-cavity diode laser (1).pdf]]
Summary: This paper gives a setup of a extended-cavity diode laser. They use machined and commercially purchased components to create a tunable laser. To tune a diffraction grating mounted on a piezoelectric motor, hand-adjustable collimating lens, and Peltier thermoelectric cooler are used in conjunction to tune their photodiode.
Questions:
- What is a Littrow configuration?
- How does a piezoelectric motor work?
- what is a Peltier thermoelectric cooler?

[[Brekke et al. - 2020.pdf]]
Summary: This paper is an extensive source on creating a extended-cavity diode laser with the use of a 3D printed structure. They were successful in making the line widths of their tuned setup to be 1.7 MHz +- 0.3. Their setup used a diffraction grating and a piezoelectric motor to make a sustainable beam.
Questions:
- Their experiment used a version that allowed 42-48 deg of motion with a 780mm 25mW laser. With gratings of 1800 lines/mm and 1200 lines/mm results were achieved of 743-825nm and 1115-1238nm wavelengths respectfully. What is our goal of wavelength, grating, and spectrum?
- Why do they not have a temperature controller?

Summary: These paper went over the complete extensive setup of a diode laser for our experiment. It has a lot of good information on what we should be looking for with specifications. They recommend a laser with a bandwidth of 1MHz.
