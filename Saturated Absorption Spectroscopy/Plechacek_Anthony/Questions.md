- What is a Littrow configuration?
- How does a piezoelectric motor work?
- what is a Peltier thermoelectric cooler?
-  Their experiment used a version that allowed 42-48 deg of motion with a 780mm 25mW laser. With gratings of 1800 lines/mm and 1200 lines/mm results were achieved of 743-825nm and 1115-1238nm wavelengths respectfully. What is our goal of wavelength, grating, and spectrum?
- Why do they not have a temperature controller?
