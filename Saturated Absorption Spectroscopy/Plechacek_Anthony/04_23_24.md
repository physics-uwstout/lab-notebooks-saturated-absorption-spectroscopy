# Daily Objectives

Plan for the day is to scan the laser with the horizontal (perpendicular the grating) axis of the diffraction grating. The other half of the time I would like to make significant progress on the final paper.


## Scanning

So no successful absorption was notice. I did learn about mode hopping a little bit more. Mode hopping occurs because the internal length of the diode cavity has mirrors on each end that can only provide feedback for certain wavelengths. Between these wavelengths mode hopping occurs since the cavity length is wrong for the associated light. At 12.5 kohms and 31 mA I was witnessing strong mode hopping. I also learned that using a phone camera can help visualize what is happening with the light. Red light is at the extent of our visual capabilities. Phone cameras can easily see this light. So, by putting my phone camera up next to the cell I can see a lot more of what is going on.

Today I made sure the diffraction grating was aligned and went through temperatures 12.5 kohm to 12.3 kohm in .5 kohm increments. At each of these temperatures I scanned through the range of current and saw nothing....
